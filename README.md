The aim of this project is to **grow client base locally, in wider areas and by the word of the mouth from the regular clients** where a potential client can go to the website and see the holistic therapists offered. The website would also spread awareness of the benefits of the holistic therapies to the individual's mind, body and soul.

## Overview

This website is built as a part of first Milestone project where the client is looking to build a wider customers base with the online presence of their business. By building this project, client's website would provide more information on the Holistic therapies offered and their health benefits.

Furthermore, after completing this project, I would be able to showcase my coding skills and knowledge of the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and User Centric Frontend Development modules learnt as part of the Code Institute’s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course.

## UX

The business aims to reach out to the population in the local community, nearby towns and cities. The client already has a loyal customer base, however, needed the online presence to reach out to the wider population, and that’s why overall simple, yet effective website is aimed. The priority focus is on direct contact and social media links.

***

**1. Strategy**

The aim of the project is that the client is looking to build a wider customers base with the online presence of their business. By building this project, client's website would provide more information on the Holistic therapies offered and their health benefits.
When visiting a website, it is very important to get the first impression right i.e. What the business is about?

### Business Goals:

- Create an online presence through website which would promote the business at a wider scale.
- Build a wider customer base in the local community, nearby towns, and the cities.
- Build community awareness of the health benefits of the holistic therapies.

### Customer Goals:

- The site to be designed on the basis of the Mobile-first approach as this is the most common form of web searching these days.
- Builds emotional connection, easy to read information, enough content to provide basic understanding of the holistic therapies.
- Images used for the various treatments would provide basic explanation each of the therapy.
- Easy to find contact details for any queries and to book appointment.
- Easy reference to the social media links throughout the site.
- Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
- Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links. 


**2. Scope**

I chose the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach which:
- It provides users with pure UX.
- As it is mobile-first website based approach which is responsive on all devices.
- It suits my current coding skills.
- It describes the treatments the business offers and focuses on contacting via email or social media. 



**3. Structure**
- The Structure is based upon the single page website with four different sections with captivating pictures which would attract the visitor's interest and enable them to quickly navigate through the website, easily obtain information and understand the treatments offered by the business.

- Contact details have been placed in contact section and social media links are provided in the footer for easy access. 

- A form will be added to the contact page with the following fields: "Name", "Email Address", and "Message Box". "Name", "Email Address" will be required in order to submit the form, "Email" input must be the valid format. User is alerted of correct input if data is invalid.


**4. Skeleton**

*wireframes mock ups:*

- [Wireframes](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with **4** main sections
  
- Home, About, Therapies and Contact
- Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 4 pages.
- Fixed Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons

**5. Surface**

I have decided on an attractive, calming landing page, and focusing immensely on the visual experience reflecting emotional connection to the user when looking at the home page, hero image. 


- Primary color: #F5DEB3 (Wheat) - This color applies to the header & footer section, and section headings which maintains contrast to the landing page, hero image.
- Secondary color: #8B4513 (Saddle Brown) - This color applies to the buttons.
- Secondary link color: #8B4513 (Peru) - This color applies to the horizontal line in the jumbotron and as a secondary link color with hover effect. 
- Background color: (#FFFFFF) - This color applies to the background, jumbotron text and button text.
- text color: (#000000) - This color applies to menu headings, section titles and body text maintaining strong, balanced contrasts.

### Typography
- "Oswald" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for main headings. This font is sans-serif typeface and most commonly used for the websites.
- "Roboto" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.

### Images

The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict holistic massage therapies and provide emotional connection to the user interested in a treatment.

## Testing

- Test carried on the **Business Logo** which appears on the left of the menu bar to ensure it points to the Home page.
- Test carried on the **About, Therapies and Contact** pages/links in menu bar to ensure it points to each page and positions at the same eye level for each page.
- Test carried on the **Social Media icons** in the Footer to ensure the specific link opens the correct pages, and in the new tab. 
- Test carried on the **Read more** button link on the Home page to ensure that it opens the Therapies page on the same site. 
- Test carried on the **Send** button on Contact page without filling any information to ensure that the error displays under the text box displaying 'Please fill out this field'.
- Test carried on the **Email** input box by entering an invalid email address to ensure that an error displays under the text box displaying 'Please include an @ in the email address'.
- Ran CSS through [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and copied the resulted CSS codes back into style.css file.
- Tested [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) No errors or warnings to show.
- Tested [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) No errors found, however see notes below:
- 1. Noted 7 warning issues related to the CSS Variables which appears to be a Parse Error. It has been noted that this is a non-issue after reading reports on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables) and other sources. It is a requested feature on [Github](https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/111) too.
- 2. Warning 'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'. Confident to ignore these after researching and a common answer is that the validator will not validate imported style sheets. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25946111/importing-css-is-ending-up-with-an-error).
- Checked grammar and spelling throughout document.
- Test carried on the Responsiveness of all pages using [Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).
- 1. [Result](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=_J82q_k2-clm-Lu46ZVgfw)
- Test carried on the overall site colours on [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/), a Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. 
- 1. Test result came back with excellent results.
- Ran README text through [Online-Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) to double-check on grammar and spelling.

**Testing User Stories**
- I want to be able to navigate through the site easily, and efficiently.
- 1. As the website is built with a single page with 4 sections acting as an individual page which provides an easy and comfortable scrolling through the website, enhancing the user experience.
- I want to be able to  know more information about the business.
- 1. The further information about the business owner is covered in the About section which is the next section to the Home page and once the client scrolls away from the HERO image, the About section will appear. 
- I want to be able to  know more about holistic therapies offered by the business, their health benefits, the cost.
- 1. The client can click the **Read More** button located on the **HERO Image** in the **Home Page** which will show the Therapies section with detailed information.
- I want to be able to contact the business to get more information and schedule appointment.
- 1. As the Form submission is not functional at the moment, however the client can contact the business through the mobile number and the email address link which opens in a separate browser window.

**Project barriers and solutions**
- Encountered an issue relating to the menu bar where the menu bar was overlapping the jumbotron section on the home page. The issue was relating to the menu bar not being fixed and hero image was not added to the home page. To fix the menu bar to top, applied Bootstrap class 'fixed top' and after adding the hero image and styling the home page, issue was resolved. 
- Encountered an issue with the title headings not aligning at the right eye level when each page is clicked. The issue related to the custom css class 'title-style' which was applied to a div container of row and in some sections, this was applied to a div container of column. This error was spotted with the help of the mentor at the second meeting.
- Encountered an issue with the contact page's submit button which was hiding under the Footer tab due to a smaller contact section page. This was resolved by applying extra padding to the content in the contact section.
- Noted an error due to the incorrect use of a semantic element 'article' on small section of the page as the text didn't require article tag as there was no heading available for the text, instead p tag was sufficient for the text. Then the article tag was removed from the text resulting no errors in the w3 html validator.

**Code validity**
- HTML - [Markup Validation W3C Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS - [Jigsaw  Validation W3C Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

**Version Control**
- Used Git for version control.

**Deployment**

The project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

- All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
- The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/Ranj247/Body-Balance-Holistic-Therapies-v2).

- Under the [settings]() section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
- Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
- Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
- There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
- The code can be run locally through clone or download.
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
- The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
